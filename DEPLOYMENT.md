# Deployment Configuration Guide - ChronaWorkflow.com

**Custom Domain:** ChronaWorkflow.com

## Current Issue
The deployment is configured as "static" but this is a full-stack application with an Express server. The deployment fails because static deployments cannot run server code.

## âœ… SOLUTION: Manual Configuration Required

The `.replit` file currently has `deploymentTarget = "static"` which causes the deployment to fail. Since this file cannot be automatically edited, you need to manually update the deployment settings in the Replit interface.

### Step 1: Change Deployment Type
1. Go to the **Deployments** tab in your Replit project
2. Click on **Configure** or **Edit Deployment**
3. Change the deployment type from **Static** to **Autoscale**

### Step 2: Update Build and Run Configuration
Set the following configuration values in the deployment settings:

**Build Command:**
```
npm run build
```

**Run Command:**
```
npm start
```

**Public Directory:**
```
dist/public
```

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
After making these changes, your deployment should:
- Build both the frontend (React) and backend (Express server)
- Start the Express server which serves the frontend and provides API endpoints
- Use the correct public directory where the built frontend files are located

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in the deployment:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `SESSION_SECRET` - A secure random string for session encryption
- `REPLIT_DOMAINS` - Your deployment domain(s), should include your custom domain
- `PORT` - Will be automatically set by Replit (usually 443 for production)

**Important for Custom Domain Authentication:**
The `REPLIT_DOMAINS` environment variable in production should include your custom domain. For example:
```
REPLIT_DOMAINS=your-replit-domain.replit.dev,www.chronaworkflow.com,chronaworkflow.com
```

## Project Structure
The build process creates:
- `dist/index.js` - Express server bundle
- `dist/public/index.html` - Frontend HTML file
- `dist/public/assets/` - Frontend static assets

## Build Process
The application uses a two-step build process:
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite builds the React application to `dist/public/`
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`

## Start Command
The production start command (`npm start`) runs:
```
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

This starts the Express server which:
- Serves the React frontend from `dist/public/`
- Provides API endpoints for the backend functionality
- Handles authentication and database operations

## Deployment Checklist
Before deploying, ensure:
- [ ] All environment variables are set
- [ ] Database is accessible from the deployment environment
- [ ] Build process completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Deployment type is set to "Autoscale"
- [ ] Public directory points to "dist/public"
- [ ] Run command is set to "npm start"
- [ ] Custom domain ChronaWorkflow.com is configured

## Custom Domain Setup (ChronaWorkflow.com)

### Steps to Configure Your Custom Domain:

1. **Deploy your application first** using Autoscale deployment
2. **Navigate to Deployments tab** in your Replit project
3. **Go to Settings** and select "Link a domain"
4. **Enter your domain:** ChronaWorkflow.com
5. **Add DNS records** to your domain registrar:
   - Replit will provide specific A and TXT records
   - Add these records in your domain registrar's DNS management
   - If your registrar doesn't support "@" hostname, use your domain name
6. **Wait for DNS propagation** (can take up to 48 hours)
7. **Verify domain status** shows "Verified" in Replit

### Important Notes:
- Replit automatically provides TLS/SSL certificates for custom domains
- Ensure no conflicting A records exist for your domain
- Avoid using Cloudflare proxied records as they can prevent certificate renewal
