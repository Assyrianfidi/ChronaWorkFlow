You are a senior full-stack application architect and developer. Your task is to design and develop a production-ready, scalable, multi-platform business management application that works for any industry where companies have workers, clients, and need invoicing and time tracking.

The app must be usable on desktop (web) and mobile (Android & iOS), be cloud-based, and support future feature expansion.

Workers scan their QR code to clock in and out using the app’s built-in camera scanner.

Automatic logging of:

Total hours worked

GPS verification on punch-in/out to ensure location accuracy.

Supervisor dashboard to approve, edit, or delete time logs.

2. Invoicing & Billing

Multiple line items, tax calculation, and discount support.

Integration with Stripe, PayPal, and bank transfer options.

Invoice status tracking: Paid, Pending, Overdue.

Export invoices to Excel/CSV for accounting.

3. Client Management
