### Question 4: "Which assumption matters most?"

**Initial Exploration** (Day 1, 10:25):
- User opened Assumptions Panel
- Reviewed all assumptions:
  - Revenue growth rate: 5% monthly
  - Expense growth rate: 2% monthly
  - Churn rate: 3%

**Sensitivity Testing** (Day 1-2):
- User adjusted revenue growth: 5% → 2%
  - Impact: 24 months → 14 months (-10 months)
- User adjusted churn rate: 3% → 5%
  - Impact: 14 months → 12 months (-2 months)
- User adjusted expense growth: 2% → 3%
  - Impact: 12 months → 11 months (-1 month)

**AccuBooks Answer** (Day 2, 10:35):
- **Most impactful assumption: Revenue growth rate**
  - 1% change = ~5 months runway impact
- Second most impactful: Churn rate
  - 1% change = ~1 month runway impact
- Least impactful: Expense growth rate
  - 1% change = ~0.5 month runway impact

**Decision Made** (Day 2, 10:35):
- ✅ **Focus on revenue growth** (highest leverage)
- User quote: "Revenue growth is the biggest lever. We need to focus on customer acquisition."
- Action: User prioritized revenue initiatives over cost-cutting

**Decision Enabled**: ✅ YES
