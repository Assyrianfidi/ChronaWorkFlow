**Document Date**: January 31, 2026  
**Tone**: Calm, credible, CFO-level, anti-hype  
**Constraint**: Build trust in under 10 seconds

---

## 📝 HEADLINE

**Know your runway. Make better decisions.**

---

## 📝 SUBHEADLINE

Financial forecasting for founders who need answers, not guesswork.

---

## 🎯 THREE CORE VALUE PILLARS

### 1. **Answers in Minutes, Not Hours**

Stop rebuilding spreadsheets every week. AccuBooks answers your critical questions—runway, burn rate, hiring capacity—in under 5 minutes.

**What this means**:
- Create scenarios in 2 minutes
- Generate forecasts in 8 seconds
- Compare options side-by-side instantly

**Not**: "AI-powered", "revolutionary", "game-changing"  
**Is**: Fast, reliable, purpose-built

---

### 2. **Trust the Math, Understand the Assumptions**

Every forecast shows you the calculation, the assumptions, and the confidence level. No black boxes. No magic numbers.

**What this means**:
- Click any forecast to see the formula
- Adjust assumptions to match your business
- See confidence scores (68%, 85%, 92%) based on data quality

**Not**: "Guaranteed accuracy", "perfect predictions", "never be wrong"  
**Is**: Transparent, explainable, honest about uncertainty

---

### 3. **Built for Real Decisions, Not Investor Decks**

AccuBooks helps you decide whether to hire, when to fundraise, or how to cut costs. Not to impress investors with hockey sticks.

**What this means**:
- Scenario planning (what if revenue drops 30%?)
- Risk analysis (what's our worst-case runway?)
- Decision support (can we afford this hire?)

**Not**: "Impress your board", "raise more money", "look professional"  
**Is**: Make better decisions, avoid surprises, sleep better

---

## 👥 WHO THIS IS FOR

**You should use AccuBooks if**:

- You're a founder or CFO making financial decisions weekly
- You spend 2+ hours per week updating spreadsheets
- You've made a bad decision because your forecast was outdated
- You need to answer "how long is our runway?" right now
- You want to understand the math, not just trust a number

**Specifically**:
- Solo founders and small teams (3-10 people)
- Businesses with $50k-$500k annual revenue
- SaaS, services, or e-commerce companies
- Pre-seed to Series A stage

---

## 🚫 WHO THIS IS NOT FOR

**You should NOT use AccuBooks if**:

- You need full accounting software (use QuickBooks, Xero)
- You need business plan templates (use LivePlan)
- You're idea stage with no revenue or expenses yet
- You want someone to build forecasts for you (we're self-serve)
- You need 100% certainty (forecasts are probabilistic, not guaranteed)

**Also not for**:
- Large enterprises with complex consolidation needs
- Companies requiring custom financial models
- Users expecting 24/7 white-glove support on free plans

## 🔒 TRUST FRAMING: HOW ACCUBOOKS AVOIDS BULLSHIT FORECASTS

### The Problem with Most Forecasting Tools

**Black box syndrome**: You enter numbers, get a forecast, have no idea how it was calculated.

**Overconfidence**: Tools show "Runway: 18 months" with no uncertainty, no caveats.

**Garbage in, garbage out**: Bad assumptions produce confident-looking but useless forecasts.

---

### How AccuBooks Is Different

**1. Show Your Work**

Every forecast has a "Calculation Explainer" button. Click it, see the formula:

```
Runway = Cash Reserves / Monthly Burn Rate
Monthly Burn Rate = Expenses - Revenue
```

No magic. No AI guessing. Just math you can verify.

---

**2. Honest About Uncertainty**

Every forecast shows a confidence score:

- **85% confidence**: Strong data, realistic assumptions
- **68% confidence**: Moderate data, check your assumptions
- **52% confidence**: Weak data or optimistic assumptions—be careful

We tell you when to trust the numbers and when to dig deeper.

---

**3. Assumptions You Control**

You set the assumptions (revenue growth, churn rate, expense increases). We calculate the outcomes.

If your assumptions are wrong, the forecast is wrong. But at least you know what you assumed.

**Example**:
- You assume 5% monthly revenue growth
- AccuBooks shows confidence: 52% (optimistic)
- You adjust to 2% growth
- Confidence increases to 73% (realistic)

You're in control. We're just doing the math.

---

**4. Built for Skeptics**

We assume you don't trust us. That's why:
- ✅ All calculations are transparent
- ✅ All assumptions are editable
- ✅ All data is exportable (CSV, no lock-in)
- ✅ No proprietary formulas or secret sauce

If you want to verify in Excel, go ahead. The math will match.

## 💰 PRICING ANCHORING LANGUAGE (NO NUMBERS)

### How We Think About Pricing

**Not**: "Affordable for everyone", "cheapest in the market", "free forever"

**Is**: "Priced for the value we deliver"

---

### What You Get

**Free tier**: Try AccuBooks with real data. Create scenarios, generate forecasts, see if it works for you. No credit card required.

**Paid tiers**: When you hit limits (scenarios, forecasts, team members), upgrade to get more capacity and advanced features.

**Pricing philosophy**:
- Pay for what you use (more scenarios, more forecasts, more team members)
- No surprise charges (flat monthly fee, no usage-based billing)
- Cancel anytime (no contracts, no lock-in)

---

### Value, Not Cost

**The question isn't "Can I afford AccuBooks?"**

**The question is "Can I afford to make a bad decision because my forecast was outdated?"**

If you've ever:
- Hired too early and ran out of cash
- Waited too long to fundraise and scrambled
- Cut costs in the wrong places
- Missed an opportunity because you didn't know your numbers

...then AccuBooks pays for itself in one avoided mistake.

---

### Pricing Transparency

**We show pricing upfront**. No "contact sales", no hidden fees, no bait-and-switch.

You'll know exactly what you're paying before you enter a credit card.

---

### Section 1: The Problem

**Headline**: You're making million-dollar decisions with outdated spreadsheets.

**Copy**:
Every week, you ask yourself:
- How long is our runway?
- Can we afford to hire?
- What happens if revenue drops 30%?

You open your spreadsheet. It's from last month. The assumptions are stale. You spend 2 hours updating it. By the time you're done, you're not sure if you trust the numbers.

There's a better way.

### Section 3: Trust Layer

**Headline**: We're honest about uncertainty.

**Copy**:
Most tools show "Runway: 18 months" with 100% confidence. We don't.

We show confidence scores based on:
- Data quality (how much historical data you have)
- Assumption certainty (how realistic your assumptions are)
- Model accuracy (how well the math fits your business)

**Example**:
- 52% confidence → Your assumptions are optimistic. Double-check.
- 73% confidence → Realistic assumptions. Good to use.
- 85% confidence → Strong data and assumptions. High trust.

You decide what to trust. We just show you the math.
