## 🎬 10-MINUTE EXECUTIVE DEMO SCRIPT

### **Slide 1: The Problem (60 seconds)**
"As a CFO or founder, you're making critical financial decisions every day:
- Should we hire this person?
- Can we afford this purchase?
- What happens if revenue drops 20%?
- How long is our runway?

Right now, you're using:
- Spreadsheets (manual, error-prone)
- Accountants (slow, expensive)
- Gut feel (risky)
- Competitors (opaque, untrustworthy)

**You need a financial co-pilot you can trust.**"

### **Slide 2: The Solution (90 seconds)**
"AccuBooks is a financial decision-making operating system built for executives.

**Three Core Capabilities**:

1. **Explainable Forecasting**
   - Cash runway, burn rate, revenue growth
   - Every forecast shows its formula
   - Confidence scores based on data quality
   - No black-box AI

2. **Scenario Simulation**
   - Model hiring, purchases, revenue changes
   - Risk classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
   - Month-by-month cash flow projections
   - Advisory recommendations (not autopilot)

3. **Enterprise Security**
   - Backend RBAC with 40+ permissions
   - Multi-tenant isolation
   - Plan-based limits
   - Complete audit trail

**Result**: Make critical financial decisions in under 10 minutes with complete confidence."

### **Slide 3: Live Demo - Hiring Scenario (3 minutes)**
"Let's say you're considering hiring a Senior Engineer at $120k/year.

**Step 1**: Open Scenario Builder
- Select 'Hiring Scenario'
- Enter: Salary $120k, Benefits $24k, Equipment $5k, Ramp 3 months

**Step 2**: Review Results
- Baseline runway: 150 days
- Projected runway: 120 days
- Risk level: MEDIUM (score: 45/100)
- Success probability: 55%

**Step 3**: Understand the Risk
- Top risk: 'Insufficient runway buffer'
- Critical assumption: 'Monthly burn rate remains at $10k'
- Impact if wrong: 'If burn increases to $12k, runway drops by 1.5 months'

**Step 4**: See Recommendations
- 'Delay hire by 2 months' (35% risk reduction)
- 'Reduce salary to $100k' (20% risk reduction)
- 'Enable auto-collect automation' (15% risk reduction)

**Decision made in 3 minutes with complete confidence.**"

### **Slide 4: Trust & Transparency (2 minutes)**
"Why do executives trust AccuBooks more than competitors?

**1. Visible Formulas**
- Every forecast shows its calculation
- Example: `$50,000 / ($10,000/month × 30 days) = 150 days`

**2. Explicit Assumptions**
- All assumptions listed with sensitivity ratings
- Example: 'Monthly burn rate remains at $10k' (high sensitivity)

**3. Data Sources**
- Every forecast lists its data sources
- Example: 'Bank accounts (today), Expenses (last 90 days)'

**4. Confidence Scores**
- Based on data quality, not marketing
- Example: 85% confidence (high data quality, low variance)

**5. Complete Audit Trail**
- Every action logged
- Every decision explainable
- Every change tracked

**No black boxes. No surprises. Complete trust.**"

**Multi-Tenant Isolation**
