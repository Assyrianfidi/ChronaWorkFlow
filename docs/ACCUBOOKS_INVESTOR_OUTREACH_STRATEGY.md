## 2️⃣ OUTREACH EMAILS

### **Warm Introduction Email Template**

**Subject:** Intro: [Your Name] - AI-native QuickBooks replacement (Sequoia intro)

**Body:**
Hi [Partner Name],

[Mutual Connection] suggested I reach out about AccuBooks. We're building an AI-native accounting platform that replaces QuickBooks and scales to enterprise.

The problem: 32M small businesses waste 12 hours monthly on manual bookkeeping while QuickBooks raises prices without innovation. Our solution: AI that categorizes transactions with 95% accuracy, predicts cash flow 30 days out, and saves businesses $5,000+ annually in missed deductions.

We're seeing rapid adoption—beta customers save 10+ hours monthly and 95% say they'll never return to QuickBooks. Looking at your investments in [Relevant Company], I thought you'd appreciate our AI-first approach to the $50B accounting market.

Could you spare 20 minutes next week to see the demo? I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your Name]
Founder, AccuBooks
