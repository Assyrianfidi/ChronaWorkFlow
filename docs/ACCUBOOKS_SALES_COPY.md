## 5️⃣ SALES BATTLE CARDS (INTERNAL)

### Objection: "QuickBooks is cheaper"

**Short Response:** "Actually, for the same price as QuickBooks Plus, you get twice the users, AI automation that saves 10+ hours monthly, and features QuickBooks charges $200+ for."

**ROI Framing:** "If your time is worth $50/hour, saving 10 hours monthly means $500 of value. For $9 more than QuickBooks, that's a 55x return on investment."

**Close Question:** "Would you rather save $500 monthly in productivity or save $9 on software?"

---

### Objection: "We don't need AI"

**Short Response:** "Our AI categorization alone saves most customers 5+ hours monthly. The AI CFO catches $3,000+ in missed deductions annually. It's not about needing AI—it's about leaving money on the table without it."

**ROI Framing:** "Think of it this way: if AI saves you 5 hours monthly at $50/hour, that's $250 of monthly value. The AI features pay for themselves 3x over."

**Close Question:** "How much time do you currently spend categorizing transactions each month?"

---

### Objection: "Migration is risky"

**Short Response:** "We guarantee your QuickBooks data imports perfectly in 15 minutes or we'll migrate it for free. Plus, you can run both systems in parallel for 30 days to ensure you're comfortable."

**ROI Framing:** "The migration risk is zero—we guarantee it. The risk of staying with QuickBooks is real: you're overpaying for outdated features and wasting hours on manual work."

**Close Question:** "What's the biggest concern about switching? Let me address it specifically."

---

### Objection: "We're too small"

**Short Response:** "Actually, small businesses benefit most from AI automation. Our Starter tier at $29/month replaces QuickBooks Simple Start and gives you AI features that save time even solopreneurs value."

**ROI Framing:** "If you're processing 50+ transactions monthly, AI categorization saves 2-3 hours. At $29/month, that's like paying yourself $10-15/hour for time you get back."

**Close Question:** "How many hours do you spend on bookkeeping each month?"

---

### Objection: "We're too complex"

**Short Response:** "That's exactly why businesses like yours switch to AccuBooks. Our multi-entity support, advanced automation, and AI insights handle complexity that QuickBooks struggles with—at a fraction of QuickBooks Enterprise pricing."

**ROI Framing:** "QuickBooks Enterprise costs $850/month for complexity handling. Our Business tier is $299/month with better AI and automation. That's $6,000 annual savings for more powerful features."

**Close Question:** "What specific complexity makes you think you're beyond our capabilities?"

---

### Objection: "We're locked into QuickBooks"

**Short Response:** "We make switching painless with guaranteed data migration and parallel run options. Most customers are fully operational in AccuBooks within a day, with all historical data intact."

**ROI Framing:** "Being 'locked in' is costing you $500+ monthly in wasted productivity and missed insights. The switching cost is zero—the cost of staying is thousands annually."

**Close Question:** "What would need to be true for you to make the switch?"

---

### Objection: "Your AI seems complicated"

**Short Response:** "Our AI works automatically in the background. You don't need to learn anything new—just keep doing what you do, and we'll handle the categorization, insights, and alerts automatically."

**ROI Framing:** "The complexity is on our end, not yours. You get the benefits of a $100k finance team without the complexity or cost."

**Close Question:** "Would it help to see a 2-minute demo of how the AI works in practice?"
