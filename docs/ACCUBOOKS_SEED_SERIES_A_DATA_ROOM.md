## 3️⃣ FOUNDER DEMO SCRIPT

### [Download Founder Demo Script PDF](./ACCUBOOKS_FOUNDER_DEMO_SCRIPT.pdf)

#### Opening (1 Minute)
"Every revolution in business software starts when the incumbent gets too big, too slow, and too expensive. QuickBooks is that incumbent today. I'm going to show you why AccuBooks doesn't just compete with QuickBooks—it makes them obsolete."

#### Setup (2 Minutes)
Introduce Sarah (8-employee consulting business), her QuickBooks pain points ($200/month, 10 hours wasted), and daily reality of manual categorization.

#### The "Wow Moment" (5 Minutes)
- Connect bank data (60 seconds)
- AI categorizes 1,200 transactions in 90 seconds (95% accuracy)
- Catch $2,800 duplicate payment instantly
- Show $500 monthly value for $99 software

#### Decision Intelligence (3 Minutes)
- 22-day cash flow prediction vs reactive QuickBooks
- $10,800 data entry error caught automatically
- Natural language: "Why were Q3 expenses so high?" → Instant AI analysis

#### Scale & Expansion (2 Minutes)
- Multi-entity in 2 clicks vs $850/month QuickBooks Enterprise
- Automation workflows creating switching costs
- Natural progression to higher tiers

#### Close (1-2 Minutes)
"This isn't just better accounting software—it's the first financial operating system for modern business. Every customer makes our AI smarter. The question isn't whether businesses will switch—it's how fast can we scale to meet them?"

## 4️⃣ INVESTOR Q&A KILL SHEET

### [Download Q&A Kill Sheet PDF](./ACCUBOOKS_INVESTOR_QA_KILL_SHEET.pdf)

#### Market & Timing
**Q: Why hasn't this been built?**
A: AI accuracy wasn't sufficient until 18 months ago, QuickBooks seemed unbeatable, rare cross-functional expertise required. Perfect timing now with AI maturity + price increases.

**Q: Why now?**
A: AI crossed 95% accuracy threshold, QuickBooks price increases driving complaints, remote work demands modern tools, economic pressure requires efficiency.

#### Competition
**Q: Why won't Intuit crush you?**
A: 30-year legacy codebase can't rebuild, AI bolted on not built in, business model depends on expensive upgrades. They'd have to abandon revenue model to compete.

**Q: What if QuickBooks adds AI?**
A: Already did—60% vs 95% accuracy, architecture not built for real-time ML, still has pricing trap problem.

#### AI & Defensibility
**Q: What stops competitors copying?**
A: Proprietary dataset of millions of transactions, technical complexity of real-time processing, switching costs from AI/workflow dependencies.

**Q: Is this just OpenAI wrappers?**
A: No—fine-tuning on financial data, real-time processing pipeline, domain-specific models for categorization/forecasting/fraud.
