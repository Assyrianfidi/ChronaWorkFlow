# AccuBooks Investor Q&A Kill Sheet - Seed & Series A Diligence

## 1️⃣ MARKET & TIMING

### **Why hasn't this already been built?**

Three reasons: First, AI models weren't good enough until 18 months ago—GPT-4 level accuracy is required for reliable categorization. Second, QuickBooks' distribution dominance made direct competition seem impossible. Third, building both AI models and accounting software requires rare cross-functional expertise. The timing is perfect now because AI has crossed the accuracy threshold, QuickBooks is losing market share due to price increases, and businesses are demanding automation.

### **Why now?**

Four converging factors make this inevitable: One, AI models finally achieve 95% accuracy on transaction categorization. Two, QuickBooks just raised prices again, driving record customer complaints. Three, remote work has made modern, mobile-first tools essential. Four, economic pressure means businesses must optimize every dollar of efficiency. We're at the perfect intersection of technology readiness and market pain.

### **Is accounting really broken?**

Absolutely. The average small business spends 12 hours monthly on manual bookkeeping at $50/hour—that's $600/month wasted. QuickBooks hasn't had meaningful innovation in 5 years. Sixty percent of businesses switch accounting systems every 3 years due to poor user experience. Our early customers save 10+ hours monthly and catch $5,000+ in missed deductions annually. That's not broken—that's a massive opportunity.

## 2️⃣ COMPETITION

### **Why won't Intuit crush you?**

Intuit can't crush us because they can't rebuild their core. QuickBooks runs on 30-year-old codebase with 20 million lines of legacy code. Their AI is bolted on, not built in. More importantly, their business model depends on forcing customers into expensive upgrades—$90 to $200 to $850. We win by being transparent and AI-first. They'd have to abandon their entire revenue model to compete, which they won't do.

### **What if QuickBooks adds AI?**

They already did—and it's terrible. Their AI categorization is 60% accurate versus our 95%. They can't fix it because their architecture wasn't built for real-time ML. Even if they solved the technical problem, they'd still have the pricing trap issue. We're not just better AI—we're better business model. QuickBooks adding AI is like adding a turbocharger to a horse carriage.

### **Why not NetSuite/Xero?**

NetSuite is enterprise software with $100K implementations—completely different market. Xero is strong internationally but weak in the US, with limited AI capabilities. Neither has our AI-native architecture or transparent pricing. NetSuite can't serve small businesses profitably, and Xero lacks the technical foundation for real AI. We're positioned perfectly between them.

## 3️⃣ AI & DEFENSIBILITY

### **What stops competitors from copying this?**

Three things: First, our proprietary dataset—we're training models on millions of real business transactions, which competitors can't access. Second, the technical complexity—we've solved problems most AI companies haven't tackled, like real-time transaction processing with 99.9% accuracy. Third, the switching costs—once customers build workflows and train our AI on their specific patterns, leaving is painful. Copying our features is easy; copying our data moat is impossible.

### **Is this just OpenAI wrappers?**

Not even close. We use foundation models as one component of our stack. Our secret sauce is the fine-tuning on proprietary financial data, the real-time processing pipeline, and the domain-specific models for things like cash flow prediction and anomaly detection. We're not just calling GPT-4—we've built specialized models for categorization, forecasting, and fraud detection that OpenAI doesn't offer.

### **Where is the data moat?**

Every customer makes our AI smarter. When we categorize transactions for a construction company, that improves accuracy for all construction customers. We're building vertical-specific models that become increasingly valuable. After 1,000 customers, our AI will have processed 50M+ transactions. After 10,000 customers, we'll have insights no competitor can match. Data network effects are our primary moat.

---

## 4️⃣ PRODUCT & EXECUTION

### **What's the hardest part to build?**

The real-time AI categorization engine. Getting 95% accuracy on transaction categorization while processing millions of transactions in real-time is incredibly difficult. We had to solve problems like handling edge cases, maintaining accuracy across industries, and ensuring zero downtime. It took us 18 months to perfect, but now it's a defensible competitive advantage.

### **What could go wrong technically?**

Three main risks: First, model accuracy degradation as we scale—we mitigate this with continuous training and human feedback loops. Second, performance issues at scale—we've architected with auto-scaling and microservices to handle 10M+ daily transactions. Third, data security and compliance—we're SOC 2 compliant from day one with enterprise-grade encryption. We have mitigation plans for each risk.

### **Why will users switch?**

Three reasons: Time, money, and frustration. Our customers save 10+ hours monthly immediately. They catch $5,000+ in missed deductions annually. QuickBooks keeps raising prices while adding zero value. The switching cost is zero—we guarantee perfect data migration in 15 minutes. The ROI is clear: pay $99/month, save $500+ monthly in productivity. It's an easy decision.

## 5️⃣ BUSINESS MODEL

### **Why these price points?**

Our pricing is engineered for natural expansion. Starter at $29 captures solopreneurs who'd otherwise use QuickBooks Simple Start. Pro at $99 is the sweet spot—same as QuickBooks Plus but with twice the users and AI. Business at $299 captures growing companies hitting QuickBooks limits. Enterprise starts at $5K because that's where real complexity begins. Each price point maps to a clear customer segment and growth trigger.

### **What drives expansion revenue?**

Three things: First, natural growth triggers—adding users, entities, or transactions forces upgrades. Second, AI addiction—once customers rely on insights, they won't leave. Third, workflow dependencies—business processes built in our automation engine create switching costs. Eighty percent of our Pro customers upgrade to Business within 18 months because they hit natural limits.

### **What happens when growth slows?**

We have multiple growth levers. Geographic expansion into Canada, UK, Australia. Vertical expansion into industry-specific modules. Product expansion into embedded finance—payments, lending, insurance. Platform expansion through our developer ecosystem. Even if new customer acquisition slows, expansion revenue from existing customers should sustain 40%+ annual growth for 5+ years.

## 6️⃣ UNIT ECONOMICS

### **CAC realism?**

Our $75 CAC is conservative because we have multiple acquisition channels. Google search intent is $75 but converts at 8%. YouTube demos are $60 with 12% conversion. Accounting influencer partnerships are $50 with 15% conversion. Cold outreach is $40 but scales slower. Our blended CAC is actually $65, but we're being conservative. Each channel is proven and scalable.

### **Churn risk?**

Churn is our biggest concern, but we mitigate it three ways. First, the product saves significant time and money—customers who save 10 hours monthly don't leave. Second, AI and workflows create switching costs. Third, we have proactive success outreach. Our beta cohort shows 3% monthly churn—well below the 8% industry average. We target under 5% long-term.

### **LTV confidence?**

We're confident in our $2,100 LTV because of three factors. One, our gross margin is 85%, giving us room for retention spending. Two, customers expand naturally—our average customer increases spend 25% annually. Three, our data shows retention improves with AI usage—heavy users churn 60% less than light users. Even with conservative assumptions, LTV is solid.

## 7️⃣ TEAM & FOUNDER RISK

### **Why you?**

I've spent 10 years at the intersection of AI and fintech. I led the ML team that built fraud detection models for Stripe, processing billions in transactions. I've seen firsthand how legacy accounting systems fail modern businesses. My co-founder ran product at a SMB accounting firm where we processed 50K+ businesses monthly. We've lived this problem and have the technical and domain expertise to solve it.

### **What's missing on the team?**

We're intentionally lean but have two key gaps we're filling with this round. First, an AI/ML lead to scale our model training pipeline. Second, a growth marketer to optimize customer acquisition. We don't need a large sales team initially—product-led growth is more efficient. We'll hire enterprise sales when we launch that tier in 18 months.

### **What keeps you up at night?**

Three things: First, model accuracy as we scale—every 1% accuracy drop impacts customer satisfaction. Second, QuickBooks' distribution advantage—they have massive marketing budgets. Third, execution risk—building both AI and accounting software is complex. But we have clear mitigation plans for each and the team to execute them.

---

## 8️⃣ SCALE & EXIT

### **Can this reach $100M ARR?**

Absolutely. The math works: 200K customers at $500 average ARPU gets us to $100M. That's less than 1% of the US SMB market. Our path is clear: 10K customers in Year 1, 50K in Year 3, 200K in Year 5. The market is massive, our product is superior, and our unit economics support sustainable growth. $100M is conservative—it could be much larger.

### **Who acquires you?**

Three categories of acquirers: First, major tech companies looking to enter fintech—Google, Microsoft, Amazon. Second, financial incumbents needing modern platforms—Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs. Third, strategic buyers wanting the AI platform—Salesforce, Oracle, SAP. Our AI technology and customer base make us attractive to all three.

### **IPO vs acquisition logic?**

We're building for IPO but staying open to strategic acquisition. IPO gives us maximum value creation and independence. Acquisition could accelerate market dominance. The decision point is around $100M ARR—if we're growing 50%+ annually and have 80%+ gross margins, IPO makes sense. If a strategic offer comes at 10x revenue, we'd seriously consider it.

## 9️⃣ RED FLAG QUESTIONS

### **What's the biggest risk?**

QuickBooks' distribution advantage. They have massive marketing budgets and existing relationships with millions of businesses. But their product is stagnant and customers are actively looking for alternatives. Our strategy is to win on product superiority and let word-of-mouth drive adoption. We're the better product at the same price—distribution matters less when customers are seeking you out.

### **What would kill this company?**

Two things: First, if our AI accuracy doesn't scale above 90%—customers won't tolerate errors in financial data. Second, if QuickBooks significantly drops prices and improves their AI—they could squeeze us. But both are unlikely. Our accuracy is already 95% and improving, and QuickBooks can't drop prices without destroying their business model.

### **Why might this fail?**

Execution risk is the biggest failure mode. Building AI models is hard, building accounting software is hard, doing both simultaneously is really hard. We could fail if we can't scale the AI team, if we can't maintain accuracy as we grow, or if we can't acquire customers efficiently. But we have clear mitigation plans and the right team to execute.

## BONUS QUESTIONS

### **How do you know customers will pay for AI?**

They already are. Our beta customers pay $99/month specifically for the AI features. The ROI is clear: 10 hours saved monthly at $50/hour is $500 of value for $99 software. AI isn't a feature—it's the reason customers switch. We're not selling AI; we're selling time savings and better financial decisions.

### **What's your unfair advantage?**

Our dataset and AI architecture. We're training models on millions of real business transactions that competitors can't access. Our real-time processing pipeline handles categorization in milliseconds while QuickBooks takes minutes. We have technical advantages that would take competitors years to replicate, if they could replicate them at all.

### **How do you survive the first 18 months?**

We have $1.5M in the bank, which gives us 18 months runway to $2.5M ARR. Our burn is $80K/month with this team. We need to hit $50K ARR in 6 months and $500K ARR in 18 months. Our customer acquisition economics are proven, and our product is ready. The path is clear and achievable.

### **What if OpenAI launches accounting features?**

That would actually help us. It validates the market and educates customers. OpenAI will build generic tools—we're building specialized, domain-specific models for accounting. We're the specialized application layer on top of foundation models. OpenAI launching features would increase our total addressable market, not compete with us.

---

## FINAL DEFENSIVE POSITIONING

### **The One-Sentence Defense**

"We're not just better accounting software—we're the first AI-native financial platform, built from the ground up to automate work that costs businesses $12B annually. Our technology, timing, and business model create a defensible position that incumbents can't replicate."

### **The Closing Statement**

"Every revolution in business software starts when the incumbents get too big, too slow, and too expensive. QuickBooks is exactly where Microsoft Office was in 2005—dominant but outdated. We're the Google Docs of accounting: better, cheaper, and built for how businesses actually work today. The question isn't if this will succeed—it's how big it will become."
