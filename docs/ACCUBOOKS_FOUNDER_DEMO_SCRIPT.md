# AccuBooks Founder Demo Script - Investor Meeting (12-15 Minutes)

## 1️⃣ OPENING (1 Minute)

**FOUNDER:** "Every revolution in business software starts when the incumbent gets too big, too slow, and too expensive. QuickBooks is that incumbent today. I'm going to show you why AccuBooks doesn't just compete with QuickBooks—it makes them obsolete."

*(Screen shows AccuBooks logo with tagline: "AI-Native Accounting That Replaces QuickBooks and Scales to Enterprise")*

**FOUNDER:** "What you're about to see isn't better accounting software. It's the first financial platform built around AI from day one, not bolted on as an afterthought. The difference is fundamental."

---

## 2️⃣ SETUP (2 Minutes)

**FOUNDER:** "Let me introduce you to Sarah. She runs a consulting business with 8 employees. Like most business owners, Sarah spends 10 hours every month on bookkeeping. She uses QuickBooks Plus, paying $90 monthly for 5 user seats—she needs 8, so she's paying $200 for Advanced."

*(Screen shows QuickBooks pricing page with $90 Plus and $200 Advanced highlighted)*

**FOUNDER:** "Sarah's daily reality looks like this: 200 transactions come in through her bank feeds. QuickBooks categorizes maybe 60% correctly. She spends 3 hours every month fixing the mistakes. She runs reports at month-end, discovers cash flow problems two weeks too late, and misses $5,000 in tax deductions because she can't categorize everything properly."

*(Screen shows typical QuickBooks dashboard with uncategorized transactions and basic reports)*

**FOUNDER:** "This isn't a Sarah problem—this is every QuickBooks customer problem. 60% of businesses switch accounting systems every 3 years because the tools haven't evolved in a decade. The incumbents can't fix this because their codebase is 30 years old."

## 3️⃣ THE "WOW MOMENT" (5 Minutes)

**FOUNDER:** "Watch what happens when Sarah switches to AccuBooks. I'm going to show you her first 15 minutes."

*(Founder clicks "Start Free Trial" - screen shows simple signup: email + password only)*

**FOUNDER:** "No credit card, no complex setup. Sarah connects her bank account through Plaid—60 seconds."

*(Screen shows bank connection interface - 5 bank accounts selected)*

**FOUNDER:** "Now here's where the magic happens. Sarah imports her QuickBooks data. 6 months of transactions, 1,200 total items."

*(Screen shows import progress bar: "Importing 1,200 transactions...")*

**FOUNDER:** "Watch this. In 90 seconds, our AI categorizes everything."

*(Progress bar completes. Screen shows transactions page with 95% categorized, green checkmarks)*

**FOUNDER:** "95% accuracy out of the box. Sarah's QuickBooks was at 60%. But more importantly, look what our AI found."

*(Screen highlights 3 transactions in red)*

**FOUNDER:** "These three transactions? Duplicate payment of $2,800. QuickBooks missed this. Sarah almost paid twice. Our AI caught it instantly. That's $2,800 saved in the first 5 minutes."

*(Screen shows anomaly detection popup: "Duplicate payment detected: $2,800")*

**FOUNDER:** "But here's the real value. Sarah used to spend 3 hours monthly fixing categorization. Now? Our AI handles it automatically. That's 3 hours × $50/hour = $150 of monthly value. For $99. The ROI is immediate."

*(Screen shows time savings calculator: "10 hours saved monthly = $500 value")*

**FOUNDER:** "And this isn't generic AI—this is AI trained on millions of real business transactions. It learns Sarah's specific patterns. The more she uses it, the smarter it gets."

## 4️⃣ DECISION INTELLIGENCE (3 Minutes)

**FOUNDER:** "Now let me show you what QuickBooks cannot do. This is where we move from automation to intelligence."

*(Screen shows dashboard with cash flow forecast chart)*

**FOUNDER:** "This is Sarah's cash flow forecast. It's not a historical report—it's predictive. Our AI analyzes her patterns, seasonality, and upcoming expenses. See that dip in 22 days? QuickBooks would show this after it happens. We show it before."

*(Chart highlights cash flow shortfall in 22 days)*

**FOUNDER:** "Sarah can now make decisions today, not react to problems tomorrow. She can delay that equipment purchase, follow up on late invoices, or adjust payroll timing. This is game-changing for small businesses."

*(Screen switches to anomaly detection dashboard)*

**FOUNDER:** "Our AI also monitors for unusual patterns. Last week, it flagged this $12,000 expense to a new vendor. QuickBooks would just record it. We asked Sarah: 'Is this correct?' Turns out it was a data entry error—extra zero. We saved $10,800."

*(Screen shows anomaly alert with "Unusual expense detected: $12,000")*

**FOUNDER:** "But here's my favorite part. Sarah can now ask questions in plain English."

*(Screen shows AI CFO chat interface)*

**FOUNDER:** "She types: 'Why were Q3 expenses so high?' Our AI analyzes everything and responds: 'Q3 expenses increased 23% due to one-time equipment purchase of $8,500 and seasonal payroll increase. Without these, expenses would have decreased 2%.'"

*(AI response appears on screen with detailed breakdown)*

**FOUNDER:** "This would take Sarah hours in QuickBooks—running reports, exporting to Excel, manual analysis. Our AI does it instantly. This isn't just bookkeeping—it's financial intelligence."

---

## 5️⃣ SCALE & EXPANSION (2 Minutes)

**FOUNDER:** "Now Sarah's business is growing. She's adding a new division in Texas. QuickBooks would force her into Enterprise at $850/month. Watch how AccuBooks handles this."

*(Screen shows entity creation - "Texas Division" added)*

**FOUNDER:** "Two clicks, Sarah now has multi-entity accounting. She can run consolidated reports, manage intercompany transactions, and handle tax compliance across entities—all for $299/month, not $850."

*(Screen shows consolidated P&L showing both entities)*

**FOUNDER:** "But here's what's really powerful. As Sarah grows, she automates more. This workflow automatically flags expenses over $1,000 for approval, sends invoices to customers who are late, and reconciles accounts daily."

*(Screen shows workflow builder with IF/THEN rules)*

**FOUNDER:** "Each automation saves more time, creates more switching costs, and makes Sarah more dependent on our platform. This is how customers naturally grow from $99 to $299 to $5,000+ plans—not because we force them, but because the value becomes undeniable."

---

## 6️⃣ CLOSE (1-2 Minutes)

**FOUNDER:** "What you've seen isn't just better accounting software. It's the first financial operating system for modern business."

*(Screen shows vision slide: "From Accounting Software to Financial OS")*

**FOUNDER:** "QuickBooks solves yesterday's problem. We solve tomorrow's. Every customer makes our AI smarter. Every workflow creates deeper integration. Every entity expansion increases switching costs. This isn't just a product—it's a platform that becomes more valuable with every customer."

*(Screen shows growth trajectory: 1K customers → 10K customers → 100K customers)*

**FOUNDER:** "The market is $50 billion. QuickBooks owns it today because nobody has built something fundamentally better. We have. The question isn't whether businesses will switch—the question is how fast can we scale to meet them?"

*(Screen ends with AccuBooks logo and contact information)*

**FOUNDER:** "I'd love to show you our technical architecture or discuss our go-to-market strategy. What questions can I answer?"
