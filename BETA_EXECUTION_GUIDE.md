Hi [First Name],

I'm reaching out because you're exactly the type of executive we built AccuBooks for.

✅ Gives you complete explainability

We're launching a private beta with 10 executives and would love your feedback.

**What you get**:
- Free PROFESSIONAL plan access ($99/month value)
- White-glove onboarding (we'll create your first scenario together)
- Direct line to the product team
- Shape the future of financial decision-making

**What we need**:
- 30 minutes for onboarding call
- Weekly feedback (5-10 minutes)
- Test new features as we ship them

Interested? Reply and I'll send you a calendar link.

Best,
[Your Name]
