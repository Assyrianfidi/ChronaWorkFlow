## Overview

This policy describes how the AccuBooks platform processes personal data for the specified tenant.

## Data Access Controls

- Access is controlled by tenant-scoped RBAC.
- All access and exports are recorded with immutable audit logging and evidence records.

## Data Subject Rights

Supported workflows (system-backed):

- Access request
- Data export/portability
- Rectification
- Erasure (subject to legal/financial retention safeguards)

## Retention & Legal Holds

- Retention policies and legal holds are enforced by the compliance retention system.
- Erasure may be blocked when legal holds or statutory retention applies.

## Security

Security enforcement points include tenant isolation, RBAC, and immutable audit logging.

This is a deterministic template and does not represent legal advice.
