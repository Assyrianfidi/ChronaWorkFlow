## Goals

- Detect, triage, contain, eradicate, and recover from incidents.
- Maintain evidence integrity for audits and legal review.

## Evidence Handling

- Evidence records are hash-chained per tenant.
- Snapshots can be created for audit periods.

## Notification (deterministic placeholder)

Notification timelines and channels are tenant-specific and contract-controlled.

This is a deterministic template and does not represent legal advice.
