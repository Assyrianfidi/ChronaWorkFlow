## 🚨 STOP CONDITIONS

### Immediate Stop (Pause Beta, No New Users)

**Trigger if ANY of these occur**:

1. **Trust Failure**: <50% of users reach 80%+ trust by Day 14
   - **Action**: Pause beta, investigate trust issues, implement fixes
   - **Rationale**: Core product value not validated

2. **System Instability**: Error rate >5% OR uptime <95%
   - **Action**: Pause beta, fix system issues, resume after stable
   - **Rationale**: Cannot provide reliable service

3. **Support Overwhelm**: >10 tickets/week with 1-2 person team
   - **Action**: Pause beta, improve self-serve resources, resume after manageable
   - **Rationale**: Support load unsustainable

4. **Critical Bug**: P0 bug affecting data integrity or security
   - **Action**: Pause beta immediately, fix bug, notify users, resume after fix
   - **Rationale**: Cannot risk user data or security
